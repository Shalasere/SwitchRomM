# Controls

Current Nintendo-style mapping (code-level, see `source/input.cpp` and on-screen hints):
- D-Pad: navigate lists
- A (right): Select / confirm
- B (bottom): Back
- X (top): Open queue
- Y (left): Start downloads (from queue)
- Plus / Start: Quit

Mappings and UI hints are intended to stay in sync; if you change the bindings in `input.cpp`, update these notes and the footer hints accordingly.
