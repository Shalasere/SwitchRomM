# Controls

Current Nintendo-style mapping (fixed in `source/input.cpp`):
- D-Pad: navigate lists
- A (right): Back
- B (bottom): Select / confirm
- X (top): Open queue
- Y (left): Start downloads (from queue)
- Plus / Start: Quit

UI hints match these bindings. If you change mappings, update hints/README too.
